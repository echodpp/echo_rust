## Build your own text editor in Rust

We will build our editor from scratch so you will get to learn a lot. I’ll explain each step along the way to make understanding a lot easier. It is less than 1000 lines of code and it implements all the basic features you expect in a minimal editor, as well as syntax highlighting and a search feature.
It is in 7 parts: 
- from setup (which is this part) to reading keypress and entering “raw mode”, drawing on the screen and moving the cursor around, displaying text files (making our program a text view), editing text files, and saving changes, implementing a cool search feature and finally to adding syntax highlighting.
